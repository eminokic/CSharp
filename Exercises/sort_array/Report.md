# C# Sorting 

Sorting Exercise

## Purpose

Understand how to sort in C#, and what built in functions are offerred. I learned that C# provides great tools for creating sorted, and descending arrays. For the future, I will apply other sorting algorithms into C# code to further strengthen this skillset.

```C#
"Original Array: 2, 1, 5, 3, 4"
"Sorted Array: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
"Descending Array: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1"
```

## Concepts

```C#
using namespace System

Random random = new Random(); //Creates a random object
random.Next(min, max); //Generates the next random int within min and max bounds
Array.Sort(array); //C# built in function to sort array in ascending order
Array.Reverse(array); // C# built in function to reverse arrays
```
